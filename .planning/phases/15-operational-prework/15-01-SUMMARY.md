key-decisions:

  - "ci-cd.yml deferred to Phase 16 scaffold — Phase 15 produces the repo container only"
  - "No --clone flag used during gh repo create; clone destination controlled explicitly via gh repo clone"
  - "HTTPS protocol used for clone (gh default); SSH not forced — consistent with gh auth keyring setup"

patterns-established:
  - "Portal repo at ~/claude/triarch/development/portal (sibling to admin)"

# Phase 15 Plan 01: Portal Repo Creation Summary

**Private GitHub repo MyAlterLego/triarch-portal created with README + MIT license on main, cloned locally to ~/claude/triarch/development/portal**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~5 min
- **Started:** 2026-05-08T15:20:37Z
- **Completed:** 2026-05-08T15:25:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (2 auto + 1 checkpoint auto-approved)
- **Files modified:** 0 (infra-only plan; no source files)

## Accomplishments

- Private GitHub repo `MyAlterLego/triarch-portal` created in org with README and MIT license seeded on `main`
- Local clone established at `~/claude/triarch/development/portal` tracking `origin/main`
- Phase 16 scaffolding can begin immediately — working directory exists, remote wired

## Task Commits

No source-file commits for this plan — all work was GitHub CLI operations + local clone. The planning metadata commit below captures execution.

1. **Task 1: Verify gh auth + create repo** - GitHub CLI operation (no file artifact)
2. **Task 2: Clone repo locally** - Local filesystem operation (no file artifact)
3. **Task 3: Human verify** - Auto-approved (auto_chain_active=true)

**Plan metadata:** see final commit hash below

## Files Created/Modified

- `https://github.com/MyAlterLego/triarch-portal` — Private repo, `main` branch, README.md + LICENSE (MIT)
- `~/claude/triarch/development/portal/` — Local clone directory
- `~/claude/triarch/development/portal/README.md` — Auto-seeded by `--add-readme`
- `~/claude/triarch/development/portal/LICENSE` — MIT, auto-seeded by `--license MIT`

## Decisions Made

- Repo created as private in MyAlterLego org per workspace rules
- `ci-cd.yml` deferred to Phase 16 (the phase-level success criterion about "no-op push reaching deploy stage" requires the workflow file, which Phase 16 scaffolds)
- HTTPS clone URL used (gh keyring default); no SSH forced — consistent with existing auth setup

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Verification Results

```
gh repo view MyAlterLego/triarch-portal --json name,visibility,isPrivate --jq '.name + " " + .visibility'
→ triarch-portal PRIVATE

gh repo view MyAlterLego/triarch-portal --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name
→ main

git -C ~/claude/triarch/development/portal remote get-url origin
→ https://github.com/MyAlterLego/triarch-portal.git

git -C ~/claude/triarch/development/portal rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
→ main

git -C ~/claude/triarch/development/portal status --porcelain
→ (empty — clean tree)

ls ~/claude/triarch/development/portal/README.md
→ exists
```

## User Setup Required

None — Phase 15 plan 01 is fully automated. No dashboard steps or env vars needed at this stage.

Phase 15 plan 02 (FAH backends) and Phase 15 plan 05 (OAuth secrets) will require manual GCP/Firebase configuration.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 16 scaffolding can begin: `~/claude/triarch/development/portal` exists, clean, on main
- Phase 15 plan 02 (FAH portal-prod + portal-dev backends) can proceed in parallel
- Note: `ci-cd.yml` is NOT yet in the repo; Phase 16 scaffold will add it as part of the Next.js app structure
