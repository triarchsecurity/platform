# Triarch Dev Admin

## What This Is

Operations console for managing all Triarch-deployed projects: project registry with health and release status, automated provisioning across GitHub/Firebase/GoDaddy/CockroachDB, centralized bug/feature tracking, release log aggregation, and customer-gated production deploys with Slack-driven promotion. Deployed as a Next.js app on Firebase App Hosting at `admin.triarch.dev`.

## Core Value

One control plane to create, manage, and ship Triarch projects — including a dev-to-prod gating workflow that lets customers approve releases before they go live.

## Status

**Repository:** `MyAlterLego/triarch-dev` — currently `v2.1.0` (Phase 01 complete, post-deploy HUMAN-UAT pending)

Already operational at v1.14.6: foundation, DB-backed staff/membership roles, project registry, automated project creation wizard, bug/feature reports, release log ingestion, **customer release gating workflow** (customer page → Slack notify → GitHub App promote → round-trip ingest → lifecycle timeline), OttoBot unified Slack dispatcher, project decommissioning.

**v2.0 Phase 01 (Central Secrets Vault) shipped 2026-05-04:** `triarch-vault` GCP project with 7 shared secrets, `@myalterlego/secrets@0.1.0` npm package (cache + env fallback), per-secret IAM grants for admin + CRM runtime SAs, admin app and CRM both reading from vault, staff-only `/api/platform/health/secrets` endpoint, onboarding docs Step 7.

**v2.0 Phase 05 (Customer Page RC UI) shipped 2026-05-05:** `/projects/{slug}/releases` restructured into collapsible per-branch sections (main pinned first, feature branches by recency); inline `<PreviewLink>` ExternalLink icon with disabled fallback for missing `metadata.previewUrl`; per-RC two-step approve UX with branch+version in confirm label and full cross-branch state isolation; conflict badge in section header + per row driven by `promote_attempts` query, approve hidden with "Resolve conflict to enable approval" helper, auto-clears when newer release lands. Test infra: RTL + jsdom installed, 11 new tests across 4 test files, 85/85 GREEN. Five HUMAN-UAT items deferred to Phase 7.5/8 pilot (need live multi-branch + conflict data).

**v2.0 Phase 06 (promoteAndAudit Rewrite) shipped 2026-05-05:** `promoteAndAudit` now dispatches `promote-branch.yml + {branch}` (replacing `deploy-prod.yml + {tag}`); persists `metadata.dispatch.{slackChannelId, slackMessageTs, dispatchedAt}` via `sql\`jsonb_set(...)\`` (preserves Phase 5 `metadata.previewUrl`); `notifyReleaseApproved` includes branch in OttoBot approval header (`{branch} {version} approved by {approverEmail}`); `/api/platform/promote-callback` looks up release by `(project, branch)` and posts threaded Slack reply for conflict (`:warning:` + capped file list + rebase hint), merged (`:white_check_mark:` + sha), and ci_failed (`:no_entry:` + run URL); D-11 graceful skip when metadata missing; D-15 best-effort try/catch always returns 201. New 3-test concurrent-approval suite proves D-16 per-row UUID isolation. `docs/onboarding-projects.md` Step 9 documents consumer's `promote-branch.yml@v3` stub + `ADMIN_API_TOKEN`. 105/105 tests GREEN. Four HUMAN-UAT items batched with Phase 8 Truth+Treason pilot.

**v2.0 Phase 07 (OttoBot Dispatcher Hardening) shipped 2026-05-05:** New `src/lib/slack-audit.ts` (`recordSlackAudit` + `hashSlackPayload`) wraps `slack_action_audit` insert in best-effort try/catch (D-08); fire-and-forget `void recordSlackAudit(...)` wired at 15 return paths in `/api/slack/interact`. New `POST /api/slack/commands` route handles `/triarch deploy <project> <version>` (staff-only, dispatches `promote-branch.yml`), `/triarch status <project>` (Block Kit response), and empty `/triarch` (help text). New `POST /api/slack/events` route handles `app_mention` (status mirrored via shared `slack-status.ts` Block Kit builder), with `url_verification` BEFORE HMAC (D-19) and `Map<string, number>` FIFO event-id dedup (D-20). New staff-only `/admin/platform/slack-audit` page (server component + `SlackAuditClient.tsx` + load-more API endpoint): 4 URL-mirrored filters (action_id, actor_email, date from/to), PAGE_SIZE=50, color-coded status badges, click-to-expand row detail. `scripts/seed-slack-audit-nav.sql` adds the staff-only nav entry to `menu_pages`. `docs/onboarding-projects.md` Step 10 documents Slack App scope upgrade procedure (3 scopes: chat:write.public, app_mentions:read, commands; slash command URL; Events API URL; OAuth reinstall). 126/126 tests GREEN. Three HUMAN-UAT items pending (SQL seed application, Slack App scope upgrade, E2E smoke test) — Mike completes post-deploy.

**v2.0 Phase 7.5 (Dev Cluster + Admin Dev Backend) — code complete 2026-05-05; HUMAN runbook pending:** Code deliverables (`scripts/provision-dev-dbs.sql` with 6 idempotent CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS for admin_dev/portal_dev/darksouls_dev/tmi_dev/truthtreason_dev/www_dev; shared-workflows v4 changes on `feat/v4-environment-input` branch — `deploy-firebase.yml` adds `environment: dev|prod` input with backwards-compat default `prod`, NEW reusable `db-migrate.yml` reads env-specific DATABASE_URL secret + runs `drizzle-kit push`; admin `apphosting.yaml`/`apphosting.prod.yaml` overlay split per Pitfall-1 guard (prod COMPLETE config preserves `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`); `docs/onboarding-projects.md` Step 11 generalizes the convention; `07.5-PHASE-4-UAT-CLOSURE.md` template + `07.5-HUMAN-UAT.md` mirror both committed) all verified. 126/126 tests still GREEN. **17 HUMAN runbook items in `07.5-RUNBOOK.html` pending Mike's hands-on action**: provision new CRDB Cloud cluster (A-1, A-2), create `<app>-dev` FAH backends across 6 projects with `DATABASE_URL_DEV` secrets (B-1..B-6), tag shared-workflows@v4 after admin canary verifies and bump consumer ci-cd.yml refs (C-1..C-3), exercise Phase 4 deferred UAT scenarios against admin-dev (D-1..D-4) and mark `04-HUMAN-UAT.md` resolved (D-5).

**Active milestone: v2.0 — Multi-Branch RC + Central Vault + OttoBot Brain** (in progress)
- Headline: customer-gated parallel release candidates with auto-rebase-and-merge promotion, unified credential storage, and OttoBot as the canonical Slack control plane.
- Phases 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 7.5 (code) complete — Phase 8 (Truth+Treason pilot) gated on Mike completing the 7.5 runbook.

## Current Milestone: v2.1 — Pipeline UI

**Goal:** Make the dev→prod CI/CD pipeline that v2.0 built **legible and operable from the admin/customer web surfaces**. Today the cluster, dev backends, customer release-gating page, GitHub App, OttoBot dispatcher, and promote-branch workflow all work — but the visualization and control loop runs through Slack and tribal knowledge. v2.1 closes that loop: per-project prod-vs-dev at a glance, on-demand branch previews customers can drive themselves, web-UI promotion (Slack alongside, not replaced), bidirectional bug/feature ↔ release linkage with filterable views, and "what's changed between dev and prod" surfaced on both admin and customer pages.

**Target features:**
- Admin home: per-project prod/dev versions side-by-side, pending-approval count, last-deploy timestamp, link straight to release page
- Per-project admin pipeline page (consolidated view: env state, branch RCs, deploy history)
- Customer release page: branch selector — customer admin clicks "Preview this branch" on any RC to swap dev backend's deploy
- Branch swap concurrency: while one swap is in flight, other RCs disabled with "branch X currently previewing"
- Web-UI **Promote to prod** button on approved RCs (admin role); calls same `dispatchWorkflow` as Slack — both paths post Slack notifications
- Bug/feature ↔ release linkage: release entries link to bug/feature IDs (clickable); bug/feature detail pages show "Released in vX.Y dev / vA.B prod"
- Auto-detect bug/feature IDs from commit messages (parses `#BUG-123`, `closes FEAT-45`, `fixes #99`); authoring UI shows detected IDs with manual add/remove
- Customer page filterable by entry type: bug fixes, feature releases, other
- "What's changed between dev and prod" view: compact on admin pipeline-at-a-glance + expanded on per-project page + summary section atop customer release page
- Discoverability fixes: every admin project tile links to `/projects/<slug>/releases`; hosted dev URLs surfaced from the customer page

**v2.0 status:** Multi-Branch RC + Central Vault + OttoBot Brain. Phase 7.5 (dev cluster + 5 dev backends + admin overlay architecture + Slack scope upgrade + Phase 7 schema migrations + hostname routing + custom-domain DNS for triarch.dev apex / tmiengine.com tmi-dev / triarch.dev darksouls-dev) shipped 2026-05-06. Phase 8 (Truth+Treason pilot of multi-branch flow) deferred — folded into v2.1 since the parallel-RC UX it would have validated is what v2.1 actually builds.

## Requirements

### v2.1 (Active)

See `REQUIREMENTS.md` — defined 2026-05-07.

### v2.0 (Shipped 2026-05-06, pending milestone-close audit)

Multi-Branch RC + Central Vault + OttoBot Brain. 8 phases (01–07.5). See MILESTONES.md once `/gsd:complete-milestone` runs.

### Already Shipped (v1.14.6 → v1.13.1)

**v1.14 (Customer Release Gating, shipped 2026-05-04):**
- DB-backed staff role + per-project membership replaces hardcoded email allowlist
- `release_feedback`, `release_approvals` tables; `release_logs` extended with env/status/commit_sha/deployed_at/promotion_dispatched_at/by
- Customer-facing `/projects/{slug}/releases` page: two-step approve, inline reject form, feedback compose, lifecycle timeline
- OttoBot unified Slack dispatcher at `/api/slack/interact` (signature-verified, routes by action_id)
- GitHub App (`Triarch Release Gate`) for promotion dispatch — RS256 JWT signer, 50-min token cache, single-flight latch
- Round-trip ingest endpoint `/api/releases/promoted` (per-project Bearer auth, atomic, idempotent)
- Onboarding runbook at `docs/onboarding-projects.md`

**v1.13 and earlier:**
- Foundation, App Hosting, NextAuth Google OAuth with email allowlist
- Project registry table with status, repo, domain, Firebase project, CRDB cluster/DB
- Automated project creation wizard (scaffold-repo, provision-db, provision-dns)
- Cascading project decommissioning
- Bug reports + feature requests submission, list, ingestion API, status workflow transitions
- Release log table + viewer + GitHub webhook backfill
- Slack bug-action / feature-action interactivity (now routed through OttoBot dispatcher)

### Backlog (post-v1.14.0)

See `BACKLOG.md`. Notable punts: project detail page (PROJ-03), bug Kanban (BUG-03), bulk bug ops (BUG-06), feature detail (FEAT-04), automated CI/CD file injection on project creation (CREATE-03/07), customer admin email seeding in creation wizard (CREATE-10/11), data migration from darksouls-rpg (MIG-*).

### Out of Scope

- Customer-facing portal (that's triarchsecurity-portal) — separate concern
- CRM/sales features (that's triarch-security CRM) — separate concern
- Game-specific features (that's darksouls-rpg) — projects are consumers, not built here
- CI/CD execution (handled by shared-workflows) — this console triggers and monitors, doesn't run pipelines

## Constraints

- **Stack**: Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, Tailwind v4, Drizzle ORM (already inherited at v1.13.1)
- **Auth**: NextAuth v4 + Google OAuth, JWT session strategy (already inherited; staff bypass currently hardcoded `email.endsWith('@triarchsecurity.com')` in `src/lib/auth.ts` — Phase 1 of this milestone moves it to a DB-backed role)
- **Database**: CockroachDB on `triarchdev-24092` cluster, database `triarch_dev` (already inherited)
- **Driver**: `pg.Pool` (already inherited)
- **Shared UI**: `@myalterlego/shared-ui ^1.2.0` (already inherited)
- **Deploy**: Firebase App Hosting on `angular-concord-489522-c4`, domain `admin.triarch.dev`
- **CI/CD**: shared-workflows pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)

## MCP servers available

- `mcp__godaddy__` — DNS management, domain configuration
- `mcp__firebase__` — App Hosting, project config, auth
- `mcp__github__` — Repo creation, workflow setup, secrets

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Customer-gated prod deploys, central UI in admin.triarch.dev | One control plane scales across all customer projects; staging-embedded panels would fragment | 2026-05-03 |
| Slack App + GitHub App (not webhook + PAT) | Interactive buttons + signed callbacks + per-installation rotatable creds | 2026-05-03 |
| Truth+Treason as gating pilot | Real customer, single dev/prod pair, low blast radius if rough edges surface | 2026-05-03 |
| DB-backed role replaces hardcoded staff email check | Existing `email.endsWith('@triarchsecurity.com')` in `src/lib/auth.ts` doesn't scale; membership table needed for project-scoped customer access | 2026-05-03 |
| Schema additions to `releaseLogs` (env, status, commit_sha, deployed_at) before any gating UI | Cannot build approval workflow on a release row that doesn't track environment or lifecycle status | 2026-05-03 |
| Scope reset from 7-phase greenfield to single v1.14.0 milestone | Codebase audit at v1.13.1 found Foundation/Projects/Bugs/Features/Releases already shipped; greenfield plan would re-implement existing work | 2026-05-03 |

## Pre-existing decisions inherited from v1.0–v1.13 (observational, not active)

These are characteristics of the existing codebase that this milestone respects rather than relitigating:

- **Auth**: NextAuth v4 + Google OAuth, JWT strategy, email allowlist
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit `db:push`
- **Driver**: `pg.Pool` against CRDB
- **Shell**: AdminSidebar + admin layout, dark theme, golden accent (post-v1.7.0 rebrand)
- **URL pattern**: existing admin pages live under `/admin/*`; gating UI introduces customer-facing `/projects/{slug}/*`

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
