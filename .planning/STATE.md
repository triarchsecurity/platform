# Triarch Dev Admin — Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (last updated 2026-05-03 — scope reset post-audit)

**Core value:** One control plane to create, manage, and ship Triarch projects — including a dev-to-prod gating workflow that lets customers approve releases before they go live.
**Current focus:** Phase 01.1 — membership-enforcement-audit

## Active Milestone: v1.14.0 — Customer Release Gating

**Goal:** Customer admins approve dev releases via admin.triarch.dev → Slack interactive buttons → GitHub App workflow_dispatch → status round-trips back; Truth+Treason is the pilot.
**Phases:** 6 (Phase 1.1 inserted)
**Requirements:** 42 (32 original + 10 added in Phase 1.1)
**Status:** Executing Phase 01.1

## Decisions

| Date | Phase/Plan | Decision |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 2026-05-03 | 01-01 | New releaseLogs columns (env/status/commit_sha/deployed_at) are nullable — legacy rows NULL until Mike runs backfill SQL |
| 2026-05-03 | 01-01 | project_members email uniqueness is case-insensitive via lower(email) in uniqueIndex — stored as-entered |
| 2026-05-03 | 01-01 | staff role uses wildcard project_key='*' row — single table for all access control |
| 2026-05-03 | 01-01 | Backfill SQL uses WHERE NOT EXISTS (not ON CONFLICT) — consistent idempotency across all three statements |
| 2026-05-03 | 01-01 | No Drizzle relations() for new tables in Phase 1 — Phase 2 adds them when customer releases page consumes them |
| 2026-05-03 | 01-02 | getCurrentUserContext returns null (not fallback context) on DB error — caller decides fallback policy |
| 2026-05-03 | 01-02 | env-allowlist fallback in signIn is intentional for v1.14 rollout — slated for removal in v1.15 once staff seeding stable |
| 2026-05-03 | 01-04 | Non-staff with empty memberships returns { projects: [] } (200) not 403 |
| 2026-05-03 | 01-04 | env validation silently coerces invalid values to 'dev' for CI backwards compat |
| 2026-05-03 | 01-04 | status='dev' is server-controlled on insert; Phase 2 gating is only transition path |

- [Phase 01]: requireStaff() helper is local to each route file (copy-paste is fine per Plan 04 note — no shared import coupling)
- [Phase 01]: Manage Members button rendered for all /admin users (access enforced server-side); conditional isStaff render deferred to post-pilot if /admin widens access
- [Phase 01.1-01]: requireAdmin preserved as deprecated alias of requireSignedIn — identical signature keeps 32 callsites compiling through v1.14.x rollout
- [Phase 01.1-01]: DB unreachable in requireStaff/requireMembership returns 403 (fail-closed) — cannot prove role without successful lookup
- [Phase 01.1]: access-logs classified staff-only despite project column — audit trail is internal accountability, not customer data
- [Phase 01.1]: reports/[id] DELETE restricted to staff-only within Plan 05 despite project-detail classification
- [Phase 01.1]: projects/route.ts GET keeps existing membership filter; POST uses requireStaff — dual method treatment within Plan 04
- [Phase 01.1-04]: reports/route.ts classified project-list (not staff-only) — reports are customer-deliverable, non-staff see only their project's reports
- [Phase 01.1-03]: settings/route.ts and service-offerings/route.ts POST preserve { error, session } destructure — session used for userId/createdBy
- [Phase 01.1-03]: No ctx added speculatively to any callsite — none of the 23 handlers use ctx in body logic

## Stopped At

Completed 01.1-03-PLAN.md (wave 2 parallel) — all 23 staff-only endpoints migrated to requireStaff(). Build green. Phase 01.1 code execution complete; Plan 06 (UAT + deploy) is next.

## Repository state

`MyAlterLego/triarch-dev` is at `v1.13.1` — foundation, projects, bugs, features, and release-log ingestion are already shipping. This milestone builds on top; nothing in v1.13 is being rewritten.

## Backlog

See `.planning/BACKLOG.md` for items punted from this milestone (PROJ-03, BUG-03, BUG-06, FEAT-04, CREATE-03/07/10/11, MIG-01..03, multi-staging environments, auto-rollback, N-of-M sign-offs).

## History

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2026-04-07 | Project initialized in `.planning/` with 6 phases, 34 requirements (greenfield assumption) |
| 2026-05-03 | First scope expansion: added customer membership and release gating (7 phases, 56 reqs). Treated project as greenfield. |
| 2026-05-03 | Audit: codebase actually at `v1.13.1` with foundation/projects/bugs/features/releases already shipped. Greenfield plan would re-implement existing work. |
| 2026-05-03 | Scope reset to single milestone v1.14.0 — Customer Release Gating only. 5 phases, 32 reqs, no rework of v1.13. Pre-existing gaps (project detail page, bug Kanban, etc.) moved to BACKLOG.md. |
| 2026-05-03 | Phase 01 deployed live — apphosting.yaml fix (PR #6) bound NODE_AUTH_TOKEN→GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN secret; first successful FAH rollout in 2 days. Cloud Run revision triarch-dev-build-2026-05-03-005 serving traffic. UAT items 1, 2, 7 verified. |
| 2026-05-03 | Live test with mike@mikegeehan.com (darksouls-rpg admin, non-staff) revealed access-control gap: 32 endpoints using requireAdmin() check session-only, not staff role. Inserted Phase 1.1 (Membership Enforcement Audit) before Phase 2; added MEMBER-AUDIT-01..10 reqs. |
