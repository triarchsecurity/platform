# Triarch Dev Admin — Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (last updated 2026-05-04 — v2.0 milestone started)

**Core value:** One control plane to create, manage, and ship Triarch projects — including a dev-to-prod gating workflow that lets customers approve releases before they go live.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — shared-workflows-hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 03
Plan: Not started

## Active Milestone: v2.0 — Multi-Branch RC + Central Vault + OttoBot Brain

**Goal:** Three intertwined initiatives — multi-branch parallel RCs with auto-rebase-and-merge promotion, central credential vault on GCP Secret Manager, OttoBot dispatcher hardening with expanded Slack scopes.
**Phases:** 8 (reset to Phase 1 for v2.0)
**Requirements:** 31 mapped (VAULT ×7, SCHEMA ×3, WORKFLOW ×5, RC ×8, OTTOBOT ×6, PILOT ×2)
**Status:** Ready to plan

## Performance Metrics

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Active decisions from v1.14.0 that carry forward into v2.0:

- [v1.14 Phase 04]: promoteAndAudit fire-and-forget dispatch pattern (Slack 3-sec rule) — v2.0 Phase 6 extends same pattern
- [v1.14 Phase 03]: Per-project Bearer auth on `/api/releases/promoted` — Phase 2 shared-workflows must include token
- [v1.14 Phase 04]: apphosting.yaml RUNTIME-only (no availability field) for secrets — vault migration must follow same pattern
- [v1.14 Phase 05]: YAML field case distinction: ci-cd.yml camelCase / deploy-prod.yml snake_case — Phase 2 must respect both conventions
- [Phase 03]: Three verification options in SCHEMA-03 runbook (existing workflow / one-shot / direct API) — Option A recommended; avoids Option B overhead when write-capable workflow already exists
- [Phase 03-01]: branch column left nullable (no .notNull()) to match v1.14 env/status precedent; DEFAULT handles new inserts, backfill UPDATE handles legacy rows
- [Phase 03-01]: DB push deferred to Mike post-merge — DATABASE_URL is Firebase App Hosting secret; same precedent as v1.14 Phase 02-01/04-01
- [Phase 03]: actor_email nullable in slack_action_audit — unmapped Slack users have null email; actor_slack_id always present
- [Phase 03]: No relations() block for slackActionAudit — audit logs are immutable standalone; no FK to any other table
- [Phase 02-02]: All ${{ }} expressions moved to env: blocks in run: steps — required for actionlint/shellcheck compliance; standard pattern for shared-workflows steps
- [Phase 02-02]: snake_case payload enforced (commit_sha, deployed_at, deployed_by) in deploy-prod.yml — /api/releases/promoted requires snake_case (different from dev endpoint camelCase)
- [Phase 02-01]: previewUrl stored in metadata JSONB (not new column) — keeps Phase 2 schema-free per D-13
- [Phase 02-01]: Two mutually-exclusive FAH deploy steps in deploy-firebase.yml: main vs branch-preview, driven by git_branch input
- [Phase 02-03]: v2 tag moved from merge commit to fix commit after canary exposed version extraction bug — acceptable since v2 had no consumers at initial tag time
- [Phase 02-03]: branch column added via ALTER TABLE (not drizzle-kit push) because drizzle-kit hung on CockroachDB — direct SQL is reliable fallback for schema changes
- [Phase 02-03]: notify.yml@v1 coexists with deploy-firebase.yml@v2 with no conflicts — confirmed by admin canary; CRM can safely bump deploy ref without touching notify ref
- [Phase 02-shared-workflows-hardening]: CRDB projects table uses api_key (snake_case) not apiKey — raw SQL must use api_key; Drizzle maps to apiKey in TypeScript
- [Phase 02-shared-workflows-hardening]: CRM flush-changelog (legacy RELEASE_LOGS_API_URL) coexists with WORKFLOW-01 deploy-firebase@v2 callback — two separate release_logs rows per deploy
- [Phase 02-shared-workflows-hardening]: CRM version.ts (v-prefixed literal) is out of sync with package.json — separate CRM ops concern; WORKFLOW-01 callback works correctly with whichever version is extracted

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- VAULT-05 and VAULT-06 require deploying to two separate Firebase projects (triarch-dev admin + triarchsecurity-admin CRM) — coordinate deploy order with Phase 1 plan
- SCHEMA-03 (GitHub App permission upgrade) requires manual re-authorization in GitHub — human action required; plan must include runbook step
- WORKFLOW-01/02 (shared-workflows cross-repo changes) require pushing to MyAlterLego/shared-workflows repo — different repo from triarch-dev; plan must note this
