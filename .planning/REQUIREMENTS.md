# Requirements: v2.2 Customer Portal Split

**Defined:** 2026-05-08
**Core Value:** One control plane to create, manage, and ship Triarch projects — including a dev-to-prod gating workflow that lets customers approve releases before they go live.
**Milestone Goal:** Fork the customer-facing surface out of `admin.triarch.dev` into its own Next.js app at `portal.triarch.dev`. Mirror the existing `triarchsecurity-admin` (staff) / `triarchsecurity-portal` (customer) precedent. Customers stop logging into a domain literally named "admin"; staff stop sharing host + cookies + blast radius with customers.

## v2.2 Requirements

Requirements for the milestone. Each maps to exactly one phase via the Traceability section.

### Operational Foundation

Repository, DNS, OAuth, and FAH backend prerequisites that must exist before app code ships.

- [x] **OPS-01**: New repository `MyAlterLego/triarch-portal` exists with admin-equivalent CI/CD scaffolding (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` calling shared-workflows@v4)
- [x] **OPS-02**: Two new Firebase App Hosting backends in project `triarch-dev-website`: `portal-prod` (custom domain `portal.triarch.dev`) and `portal-dev` (auto domain `portal-dev.triarch.dev`)
- [x] **OPS-03**: GoDaddy DNS records for `portal.triarch.dev` (A/CNAME pointing at FAH backend) verified resolving + 200-OK landing page
- [ ] **OPS-04** (DEFERRED — see 15-05-SUMMARY.md): Google OAuth client `Triarch Dev` updated with second authorized redirect URI `https://portal.triarch.dev/api/auth/callback/google` and localhost dev URI `http://localhost:3002/api/auth/callback/google`
- [x] **OPS-05**: GCP secrets `PORTAL_NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (random 32-byte) created in `triarch-vault` with secretAccessor binding for both `portal-prod` and `portal-dev` runtime SAs

### Shared Package

The Drizzle schema + select helpers extracted into a private GitHub Packages npm module that both apps consume.

- [x] **PKG-01**: `packages/triarch-shared/` directory in admin repo containing schema.ts, auth-context.ts, sanitize-commit.ts, slack-status.ts with publish workflow on tag `shared/v*`
- [x] **PKG-02**: `@myalterlego/triarch-shared@0.1.0` published to GitHub Packages and verified installable via `npm install`
- [x] **PKG-03**: Admin repo refactored to re-export schema + helpers from `@myalterlego/triarch-shared` (bumps admin to v2.9.0, no functional change, all 324+ tests still GREEN)
- [x] **PKG-04**: CI gate prevents merging admin PRs that introduce schema changes without bumping the shared package version

### Hostname Guard Inventory

Catalog and harden the v2.1 hostname-aware routing before introducing a second valid host.

- [x] **HOST-01**: Inventory document at `.planning/host-guard-inventory.md` listing every `host ===` / `headers().get('host')` / `x-forwarded-host` reference in admin codebase (with file:line + current behavior)
- [x] **HOST-02**: Admin's `src/proxy.ts` (or `src/middleware.ts`) fails closed for hosts that are neither `admin.triarch.dev` nor `localhost:300x` — returns 404 instead of marketing fallback

### Portal Auth Scaffolding

NextAuth v4 setup with brand isolation, customer-only authorization, and staff "switch to admin" callout.

- [x] **AUTH-01**: Portal NextAuth v4 config with `__Host-` cookie prefix in production, NO `domain` attribute set (host-only scope)
- [x] **AUTH-02**: Portal uses `PORTAL_NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (distinct from admin's `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`) so JWTs cannot be cross-replayed
- [x] **AUTH-03**: Portal `signIn` callback enforces customer-membership rule — rejects users with no `project_members` row; staff users are allowed in but flagged for the callout in AUTH-04
- [x] **AUTH-04**: Authenticated staff users see a persistent "Switch to admin.triarch.dev" callout banner; viewer/admin customer users do not see it
- [x] **AUTH-05**: Vitest assertion that the portal `Set-Cookie` header for the session token contains `__Host-` prefix and lacks any `Domain=` attribute
- [x] **AUTH-06**: Vitest grep-test that no portal source file references the OAuth `sub` claim (everywhere keys on `email`)
- [x] **AUTH-07**: Login wall on portal `/` (unauthenticated → /login); post-login routing (0 memberships → empty state with "Contact your project admin" copy; 1 → auto-redirect to that project; 2+ → /projects list)

### Database Connectivity

Portal DB access with defense-in-depth schema-write protection.

- [x] **DB-01**: Portal `src/lib/db.ts` connects to the same CockroachDB cluster + database via `pg.Pool`; reuses `DATABASE_URL` secret (or `DATABASE_URL_DEV` for dev backend)
- [x] **DB-02**: New CockroachDB user `portal_runtime` with GRANT SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on the v2.2 tables (no DDL grants); portal connects with this role; admin retains its current admin role
- [x] **DB-03**: Portal `package.json` does NOT include `db:push` or `db:generate` scripts (Drizzle is read-only-from-portal's-perspective); admin remains sole migration authority
- [x] **DB-04**: Smoke test from portal: `ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN test text` returns CockroachDB permission denied

### URL Centralization (Admin Refactor)

Refactor admin to construct customer-facing URLs through a single helper before portal ships.

- [x] **URL-01**: New `src/lib/urls.ts` in admin with helpers: `customerProjectUrl(slug)`, `customerReleaseUrl(slug)`, `customerBugUrl(slug, id)`, `customerFeatureUrl(slug, id)`, all reading `PORTAL_BASE_URL` env (default `https://portal.triarch.dev`)
- [x] **URL-02**: All admin Slack message builders, OttoBot Block Kit constructors, GitHub release-note templates, and email templates refactored to call `urls.ts` helpers
- [x] **URL-03**: ESLint rule (`no-restricted-syntax`) blocks raw `https://admin.triarch.dev/projects/` literals outside `src/lib/urls.ts` — CI fails on violation

### Release Page Port (Read Surface)

Lift-and-shift the v2.1 customer release page to portal as read-first; mutations land in PORTAL-WRITE phase.

- [x] **PORTAL-01**: Portal route `/projects/[slug]/releases` renders the existing release page with FilterChips, WhatsComingCard, BranchSection, ReleasesClient, lifecycle timeline — visually identical to admin
- [x] **PORTAL-02**: Portal route `/projects` renders project tile list (membership-filtered) using shared `getProjectPipelineSummaries()` helper from the shared package
- [x] **PORTAL-03**: Non-member access to `/projects/[slug]/*` returns 404 (NOT 403) — no membership-existence leak
- [x] **PORTAL-04**: Portal pages render with mobile-responsive layout for read paths (release list, bug list, feature list, project list); approve/branch-swap controls remain desktop-optimized

### Release Page Port (Write Surface)

Customer write paths: approve, reject, feedback, branch preview swap, plus Slack/GitHub integration.

- [x] **WRITE-01**: Portal API routes `POST /api/projects/[slug]/releases/[releaseId]/approve` and `/reject` and `/feedback` (and DELETE feedback) call the same `promoteAndAudit` flow + write `release_approvals.actor_source='portal'`
- [x] **WRITE-02**: Portal API route `POST /api/projects/[slug]/branch/preview` and `GET /status` mirror the v2.1 admin endpoints (atomic lock, branch regex guard, 8-min timeout, branch-guarded auto-clear)
- [x] **WRITE-03**: Portal binding for `FAH_PROMOTER_SA_KEY` secret in its apphosting.yaml; FAH compute SA + service-agent IAM bindings on the secret (matches admin's pattern)
- [x] **WRITE-04**: Portal posts customer-side Slack notifications via `PORTAL_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` directly; for GitHub workflow dispatch (promote-branch.yml), portal calls admin via internal HMAC-signed POST `/api/internal/dispatch` (admin retains GitHub App key custody)
- [x] **WRITE-05**: Two-step approve UX, conflict badge, branch lock disable propagation — all preserved from v2.1

### Bug + Feature Customer Surface

Customer-readable views + customer-facing submission forms (the two net-new primitives).

- [x] **BUG-01**: Portal route `/projects/[slug]/bugs` renders membership-scoped bug list (each project's bugs only); supports the existing status pills + filter UI
- [x] **BUG-02**: Portal route `/projects/[slug]/bugs/[id]` renders bug detail with `ReleasedInSidebar` reused from admin (read-only customer view; NO staff edit controls)
- [x] **BUG-03**: Portal route `/projects/[slug]/bugs/new` provides customer submission form (title, description, severity, reproduction steps); POST creates bug_reports row with reporter_email = session email + project_key from URL
- [x] **FEAT-01**: Portal route `/projects/[slug]/features` renders membership-scoped feature list with status pills
- [x] **FEAT-02**: Portal route `/projects/[slug]/features/[id]` renders feature detail with `ReleasedInSidebar` (read-only customer view)
- [x] **FEAT-03**: Portal route `/projects/[slug]/features/new` provides customer submission form (title, description); POST creates feature_requests row with reporter_email + project_key

### CI/CD + Deploy Safety

verify-deploy-target + apphosting validation prevent catastrophic cross-app deploys.

- [ ] **CI-01**: Shared-workflows `verify-deploy-target` job committed to `MyAlterLego/shared-workflows` (or admin's per-repo equivalent if v4 immutable) — fails if `${{ github.repository }}` doesn't match expected `firebase_project_id` per a committed lookup table
- [ ] **CI-02**: Per-repo deploy SAs — portal has its own `portal-deployer@triarch-vault.iam.gserviceaccount.com` distinct from admin's deploy SA
- [x] **CI-03**: Boot-time `assertEnv()` in portal validates required env vars present; missing var fails container start with clear error (Phase 24-02; admin v2.11.0 + portal v0.5.1)
- [x] **CI-04**: CI step `validate-apphosting.ts` reads apphosting.yaml + apphosting.dev.yaml against an env-name TypeScript schema — fails build on missing/typo'd binding (Phase 24-03; admin v2.11.1 + portal v0.5.2)

### Cutover

Flip 301 redirects from admin to portal; communicate the URL change to customers.

- [ ] **CUT-01**: Admin middleware 301-redirects `/projects/[slug]/*` → `https://portal.triarch.dev/projects/[slug]/*` (preserves path + query)
- [ ] **CUT-02**: Email blast to all `project_members` rows with `role IN ('admin','viewer')` notifying URL change + 90-day grace + new login URL
- [ ] **CUT-03**: Slack message URL update sweep on last 30 days of `slack_action_audit` — recreate any active threads with portal URLs
- [ ] **CUT-04**: Telemetry on admin's redirect middleware emits `redirect_hits` metric (count + path) for monitoring decay
- [ ] **CUT-05**: Kill-switch env var `PORTAL_REDIRECT_DISABLED` in admin allows reverting to in-place serving without a deploy if portal regresses

### Sunset

Final cleanup at T+90 — delete deprecated routes and dead hostname-guard branches.

- [ ] **SUN-01**: Admin `/projects/[slug]/*` routes deleted (server components + API routes that customers used)
- [ ] **SUN-02**: v2.1 hostname-aware route guards in admin (`page.tsx`, `admin/layout.tsx`, `projects/layout.tsx`, `login/layout.tsx`) deleted — admin only serves admin host now
- [ ] **SUN-03**: Admin v3.0.0 bump to mark major surface change

### Portal UI Polish (Phase 23.1)

Decimal phase inserted between Phase 23 and 24 to address customer UX gaps observed on portal v0.4.6 first sign-in.

- [x] **UX-01**: Customer on `/projects/[slug]/<any>` sees a sub-nav linking Releases / Bugs / Features with active surface visually distinguished; mobile-responsive (completed 2026-05-10; portal v0.4.7)
- [x] **UX-02**: Release log table renders `releaseLogs.status` (pending_approval | approved | rejected | promoted | superseded | dev) with color-coded badges; ENV in own column; "needs your review" rows visually distinct (completed 2026-05-10; portal v0.4.8)
- [x] **UX-03**: Project home cards replace cryptic `PROD --` with "Not yet released" copy when no prod rows exist (completed 2026-05-10; portal v0.4.9)
- [x] **UX-04**: Staff users with admin role can toggle "preview as customer" mode; cookie-based 1h TTL; cookie NEVER grants permissions (completed 2026-05-10; portal v0.5.0)

## v2.3+ Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Customer Polish

- **POLISH-01**: Email digest of pending approvals (per-customer-admin daily summary)
- **POLISH-02**: Customer-admin self-serve teammate invite (currently staff-only)
- **POLISH-03**: Bug Q&A / comment thread for back-and-forth between customer and Triarch staff
- **POLISH-04**: Approval delegation (customer admin → backup approver when out)
- **POLISH-05**: Magic-link auth alternative to Google OAuth (for customers without Google Workspace)
- **POLISH-06**: Account settings page (email change, notification preferences)
- **POLISH-07**: File attachments on bug submission (S3-backed)
- **POLISH-08**: Bulk approve "approve all clean RCs"

### Truth+Treason Pilot Reactivation

- **PILOT-01**: Re-engage Truth+Treason as v2.3 milestone candidate after portal cutover stabilizes (was deferred from v2.0)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| White-label per-customer branding | Not justifiable at 1-customer scale; v3+ if multi-customer demand emerges |
| Email/password authentication + signup | Google OAuth is sufficient; email/password adds password-management surface area |
| PWA / offline / service worker | Customer app is desktop+mobile-web; offline use case unclear |
| Real-time websocket release updates | SWR 5s polling already covers it |
| Customer-facing marketing copy | Portal is gated; no public landing |
| Public docs / portal changelog | WhatsComingCard already shows what's coming; full changelog is overkill |
| Customer billing dashboard | Out of triarch-dev scope; finances/billing tooling lives elsewhere |
| Customer-facing roadmap board | WhatsComingCard already shows it |
| Voting / upvoting on feature requests | 1-customer scale; voting is meaningful at 10+ customers |
| Customer-supplied target dates on features | Feature prioritization is Triarch's role |
| Multi-customer "switch customer" dropdown | Customer admins only have one customer org; staff use admin.triarch.dev |
| Iframe embedding admin in portal or vice versa | Brand confusion + CSP frame-ancestors='none' enforced |
| Cross-origin asset embedding in customer emails | Email links only, never embeds |
| NextAuth v5 / @auth/core migration | v5 unstable; v4 is fine; defer until forced |
| Workspace tooling migration (pnpm/turbo) | Two repos + one shared npm package is sufficient; monorepo migration is yak-shaving |

## v2.3 Requirements — Dev/Prod Contract Adoption

**Defined:** 2026-05-16
**Contract source:** [`public/ci-cd/dev-prod-customer-contract.md`](../public/ci-cd/dev-prod-customer-contract.md) (CL-1..CL-6)
**Milestone goal:** Make the contract clauses non-bypassable from the customer's perspective. Today the framework gate exists but no consumer has adopted it; today no doc codifies the customer-visible naming/badge/DB clauses; today the platform admin accepts prod release ingests even when no gate ran. v2.3 closes all three.

### CL-1 Hostname Pattern Enforcement

Every project's dev URL MUST be `<short>-dev.<zone>`; prod is `<short>.<zone>` or external brand `.com`.

- [ ] **CL1-01**: Six missing dev shortnames claimed in Firebase + DNS — `admin-dev.triarch.dev`, `portal-dev.triarch.dev`, `tmi-dev.triarch.dev`, `truthtreason-dev.triarch.dev`, `admin-dev.triarchsecurity.com`, `portal-dev.triarchsecurity.com`
- [ ] **CL1-02**: TLS provisioning verified on all 6 new hostnames (cert subject matches expected, expiry > 60d)
- [x] **CL1-03**: Admin compliance scan (in `/admin/modules/ci-cd`) flags any project whose `dev_url` doesn't end with `-dev.` segment (exception allowed when project carries documented external-brand record)

### CL-2 Persistent Environment Badge

Dev UIs MUST render a visible "DEV" badge in persistent chrome.

- [x] **CL2-01**: `<EnvBadge env={NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV} />` exists in `@triarchsecurity/shared-ui` (repo: `triarchsecurity/shared-ui`); renders only when env in `('dev','staging')`
- [x] **CL2-02**: Component emits `data-env="dev"` attribute so admin compliance scan can assert via HTML parse
- [x] **CL2-03**: Mounted in root layout of all 7 projects — Phase 29 covers platform + dev-portal + darksouls + tmi + truthtreason; Phase 33 covers security-admin; Phase 34 covers security-portal
- [x] **CL2-04**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV` set to `dev` in every project's `apphosting.dev.yaml`; set to `prod` (or unset) in `apphosting.yaml`. Phase 33/34 create the missing yamls for security-admin/portal.

### CL-3 Database Namespace Separation

Dev backend MUST connect to `<project>_dev` database; prod to `<project>`. Cluster sharing allowed; database sharing forbidden.

- [ ] **CL3-01**: For every project, `apphosting.dev.yaml` DATABASE_URL contains `/<project_key>_dev` path component
- [ ] **CL3-02**: For every project, `apphosting.yaml` DATABASE_URL contains `/<project_key>` (no `_dev` suffix) path component
- [ ] **CL3-03**: CRDB cluster has both databases (`<project>` and `<project>_dev`); migration runner ran against both
- [ ] **CL3-04**: Admin compliance scan reads both yaml files via raw GitHub content URL + asserts path suffix delta — fail if same

### CL-4 Version-Promotion Gate Adoption

Every consumer repo's prod deploy MUST declare `gate-prod-version.yml@v8.x` as `needs:`.

- [x] **CL4-01**: Platform self-adopts — `triarchsecurity/platform/.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` declares the gate, ADMIN_API_TOKEN secret bound, contrived dry-run blocks correctly
- [ ] **CL4-02**: dev-portal wired same way; gate verified blocking
- [ ] **CL4-03**: darksouls-rpg wired same way; gate verified blocking
- [ ] **CL4-04**: tmi wired same way; ALSO back-patched to v2.13.10 framework (corrected C-12 direction; remove `[hotfix-bypass-dev]` token)
- [ ] **CL4-05**: truthtreason wired same way; ALSO back-patched to v2.13.10 framework
- [ ] **CL4-06**: security-admin wired same way (depends on Phase 33 dev path existing first)
- [ ] **CL4-07**: security-portal wired same way (depends on Phase 34 dev path existing first)

### CL-5 Customer-Readable Release Page

Customer-shareable projects MUST surface `/projects/[slug]/releases` showing dev + prod lanes with diff.

- [ ] **CL5-01**: Page already exists on platform — confirm responds 200 for any project with `prod_visible_to_customer=true`
- [ ] **CL5-02**: Page renders both "On dev (v X.Y.Z)" and "On prod (v X.Y.Z)" lanes with diff summary when versions differ
- [ ] **CL5-03**: Admin compliance scan HEAD-checks the URL for any project where `prod_visible_to_customer=true`

### CL-6 Server-Side Adoption Enforcement (P0)

Admin `/api/platform/ingest/release-logs` MUST reject `env=prod` ingests without a paired pass-verdict gate audit row in prior 15 min.

- [x] **CL6-01**: Endpoint reads the most-recent `deploy_gate_check` audit row for `(project_key, action=deploy_gate_check)` written in prior 15 minutes
- [x] **CL6-02**: Endpoint asserts `verdict=pass` AND `target_version == ingested_version` AND same bearer apiKey wrote both rows
- [x] **CL6-03**: On mismatch/missing: return 409 with structured error, do NOT insert release row, write rejection to audit log
- [x] **CL6-04**: Contrived test — strip `needs: gate` line from a workflow, deploy, confirm release row never appears in DB AND compliance matrix flags project red

### Compliance Matrix UI

Live per-project, per-clause status on `/admin/modules/ci-cd`.

- [x] **MATRIX-01**: Page renders one row per project × 6 columns (CL-1..CL-6) plus existing CL-4 readiness column
- [x] **MATRIX-02**: Each cell shows green/red/grey badge with one-line reason on hover
- [x] **MATRIX-03**: Page recomputes live on each render (no stale cache); under 2s response time for portfolio-wide scan
