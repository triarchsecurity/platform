# Milestones

## v2.7 Bulk Triage Actions (L3) — BACKLOG

**Goal:** Turn admin.triarch.dev into a multi-item action surface so Mike doesn't have to triage items one-by-one. Bulk-approve N pending deal-suggestions in one click; bulk-reassign contacts across projects; bulk-archive actions before a date (mirrors the manual `scripts/.archive-stale-actions.ts` Mike ran on 2026-05-20 for 37 March follow-ups on security-admin).

**Why now (after L2):** L2 surfaces what's failing or slow at a per-cron level. L3 surfaces what's piled up at a per-queue level. Together they cover the two daily-driver friction shapes: "something's broken, fix it" (L2) and "queue is big, drain it" (L3).

**Target capabilities:**
- Multi-select on each triage / actions / inbox list view
- Bulk-approve / bulk-dismiss / bulk-reassign actions (driven by existing single-item endpoints, composed server-side for atomic write + audit per item)
- Per-batch idempotency keys (clicking twice doesn't double-apply)
- Audit JSON written per item (mirrors `docs/reports/actions-bulk-archive-apply-*.json` shape from the 2026-05-20 manual run)
- Confirmation modal showing exact row count + first 10 sample rows before commit
- "Undo last bulk action" within 5 minutes (writes a reverse-action audit row)

**Non-goals for v2.7:**
- Free-form bulk SQL (too dangerous)
- Bulk schema changes (out of scope — those go through migrations)
- Cross-project bulk (each project's bulk action is per-project for blast radius containment)

## v2.6 Cron Control Panel (L2) — BACKLOG

**Goal:** Make the cron layer (classifier, event-dispatcher, granola-synthesizer, briefing, intelligence-refresh, slack-ingest, slack-thread-attention, calendar-sync, etc.) visible and operable from `/admin/modules/cron`. Today the only way to know if a cron stopped firing is to grep FAH logs; the only way to manually re-fire one is `gcloud scheduler jobs run`. L2 makes both into UI.

**Why now (after L1):** The L1 promote-to-prod button (shipped via #117 on 2026-05-20) proves the action-button pattern. L2 applies the pattern to a higher-value control surface — cron health is the single biggest blind spot in the morning briefing (see the 2026-05-20 root cause analysis where a `channel_not_found` Slack error in the synthesizer + a missed `JOB_SECRET` hypothesis cost two hours of investigation).

**Target capabilities:**
- `/admin/modules/cron` page lists every Cloud Scheduler job per project: schedule, last_attempt, last_status, success_rate_24h, last_error (if any)
- "Trigger now" button per cron (auth-gated, JIT-creds-gated for prod jobs, audit-logged via approval_events with subject_type='cron_trigger')
- "Pause" / "Resume" toggle per cron (writes to Cloud Scheduler API)
- Heartbeat watchdog: if a cron hasn't fired within 2× its interval, the page row goes red and the morning briefing flags it
- One-click "view logs for this cron" link to FAH log viewer with the right filter pre-applied
- Per-cron config view (env vars bound, secret versions in use, last deploy)

**Non-goals for v2.6:**
- Editing cron schedules from UI (still done via apphosting.yaml + redeploy)
- Cross-project cron view in v1 (per-project only)
- Auto-remediation (L5 territory)

## v2.5 Admin Action Buttons (L1) — SHIPPED 2026-05-20 (via PR #117)

**Goal:** Take the read-only compliance dashboard and add the first action button — "Promote dev → main" — next to each project, mirroring the `gh pr create --base main --head dev` + `gh pr merge` calls Mike was running by hand on 2026-05-20.

**What shipped (PR #117 — `v2.17.0: feat(promote): auto-create dev→main PR from /triarch promote + UI button`):**
- `ensurePullRequest` helper in `src/lib/github-app.ts` — idempotent open-or-reuse semantics on (head, base)
- `POST /api/platform/projects/[id]/promote` — staff-only combined endpoint that opens-or-reuses the dev→main PR AND merges it in one call (always `merge_method='merge'` to preserve consumer projects' `verify-dev-deployed` ancestry)
- `PromoteToProdButton.tsx` on `/admin/platform/projects/page.tsx` (project list)
- Slack `/triarch promote <project>` command in `/api/slack/commands/route.ts` — same flow from Slack

**Key decision:** L1 ships as ONE combined endpoint (open-and-merge), not two separate ones (open, then merge). Rationale: the only legitimate reason to split would be a "review-then-merge" pause; admin staff doing prod promotion already have full authority and want the one-click semantic.

**Non-goals deferred to later milestones:**
- Per-project permission tiers (admin-only for v1)
- Bulk-promote across projects → see v2.7
- Auto-gating on CL-1..CL-6 compliance beyond `verdict='pass'` → infrastructure work
- Cron actions (trigger / pause / resume) → see v2.6

## v2.1 Pipeline UI (Shipped: 2026-05-08)

**Phases completed:** 7 phases, 23 plans, 43 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- Composite index `(project, env, deployed_at DESC)` on `release_logs` declared in Drizzle schema and shipped as migration 0013 — satisfying Pitfall 8 guard that index must deploy with the dashboard query
- Testable `getProjectPipelineSummaries()` server helper with DISTINCT ON query, COALESCE null handling, and what-changed one-liner derivation covering parity/dev-ahead/inverted pipeline states
- Pipeline-aware project health tiles with prod/dev stacked rows, mono version font, relative timestamps, top-right amber pending-approval pill, and what-changed one-liner wired from getProjectPipelineSummaries — version 2.4.0
- Drizzle schema adds actor_source audit column and partial unique index preventing double-promote races, migration 0014 ships as the next sequential step after Phase 8's 0013
- promoteAndAudit signature widened with nullable channelId/messageTs/slackUserName; web-origin path posts fresh Slack channel message via new postSlackChannelMessage helper; 12 Vitest tests green

- useEffect mount-fetch added to LinksClient.tsx — existing release_log_links chips now hydrate from GET /api/admin/release-logs/[id]/links on every release row expand, closing the LINK-04 chip-visibility gap
- Drizzle typed query helpers for bug/feature release history — getReleaseHistoryForBug + getReleaseHistoryForFeature with 7-test Vitest TDD suite (RED → GREEN, ISO timestamps)
- Bug detail page at /admin/modules/bug-reports/[id] with staff auth, two-column layout, and ReleasedInSidebar (text-violet-300 version mono) wired to getReleaseHistoryForBug; list page row titles now Link to detail page
- Feature detail page at /admin/modules/feature-requests/[id] with staff auth, two-column layout, and ReleasedInSidebar (reused from 12-02) wired to getReleaseHistoryForFeature; feature list row titles now Link to detail page — closes LINK-06 and completes Phase 12
- One-liner:
- SWR-driven BranchPreviewClient island with 5s polling/terminal pause, POST dispatch, in-flight banner (violet halo per DESIGN-REFERENCE), success/failed/timeout pills, toast surfaces for 400/409/502, and top-of-list integration into ReleasesClient — Phase 13 complete at v2.7.0.
- Server-side data layer for Phase 14 customer page: per-release entry-type counts from release_log_links (one inArray batch query) and aggregated "what's coming to prod" summary using release-as-unit bucketing with fixes-take-precedence, wired into page.tsx and passed as optional back-compat props to ReleasesClient
- Two new client component islands (FilterChips, WhatsComingCard) with full Vitest RTL coverage, wired into ReleasesClient via URL-mirrored filter state (router.replace shallow) and client-side useMemo filter math — delivers CUST-01, CUST-02, DIFF-02 visible surface
- BranchPreviewClient split into BranchPreviewBanner (global singleton) + BranchPreviewButton (per-section, admin-only) sharing one SWR cache key; BranchSection header restructured to avoid button-in-button; ReleasesClient mounts singleton banner; v2.8.0 closes v2.1 Pipeline UI milestone
